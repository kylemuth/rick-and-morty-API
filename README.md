# Rick and Morty API Practice

---

## Scope of Project:

For this project I utilized the Rick and Morty API to randomly generate a character with some general information.

## Lessons Learned:

### The peace of mind that refactoring code brings

At this point in time I still need to go back and refactor the JavaScript portion of this code. The main problem that I ran into with this project was cycling through each card and generating a different character versus applying the same character to every single card. This is why the same function is repeated over and over for each card versus having a succinct code block that executes the same function across each individual card.
